I want to record some of my favorite albums here. I remember the first I really enjoy one album is **[1989](https://open.spotify.com/album/1yGbNOtRIgdIiGHOEBaZWf)**. Listening to it brought me back to a time when I was young, full of energy, and surrounded by love, reminding me of why I fell in love with music in the first place.

```
25 years my life is still
Tryin' to get up that big hill of hope
```
-- *[What's up](https://open.spotify.com/track/0jWgAnTrNZmOGmqgvHhZEm)*

Lucky I'm very glad that I still have the chance to find so many great music which I'm really in love with, they gives me love, hope and peace.
