I want to record some of my favorite albums here.

Not long ago I found seems like I'm losing interesting to the musics when I was facing thousands of new songs released in one day, I remember the last album I listened carefully was **[1989](https://open.spotify.com/album/1yGbNOtRIgdIiGHOEBaZWf)** by Taylor, I was listening to this album day after day, I really like it. I was lost in the memory, I missing the days when I was listening this album when I was young, energetic and have somebody to love. Like my life, I'm losing the courage and hope to climb the top when I was facing thousands of stuffs happened in one day.

```
25 years my life is still
Tryin' to get up that big hill of hope
```

Lucky I'm very glad that I still have the chance to find so many great music which I'm really in love with, I would say, each of them are my favorite, they gives me hope, peace and energy.
