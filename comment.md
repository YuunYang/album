我希望可以在这里记录我喜欢的一些专辑。

为什么想要分享专辑呢，我觉得专辑始终是一个整体的概念，我很喜欢 Apple Music 一张唱片一张唱片的收藏逻辑，回想在实体专辑的年代，没有人会只收藏一首歌。有趣的是，最早是 Apple 把一张实体唱片里的一首首歌拿到 iTunes 上去买，如今 Apple 却变得老派起来，所以我们可以老派一点，选一张自己的喜欢的专辑，在一个惬意的下午，认真欣赏里面的每一歌，这是一件很酷的事情。

I want to record some of my favorite albums in this website.

Why I want to share albums instead of songs? I still think an albums is whole concept, I like the "favorite" logic of Apple Music, which is collect by albums but not a single song, think back to the time which we are listening the physical albums, no one collect one single song. And the interesting thing is that in the very beginning, it's Apple who sales single songs online first, now Apple Music seems to be retro, and we can also be retro, find a cozy afternoon, pick one album, and put on the earphone, and enjoy every songs in this album, that's really cool.

For my music taste, I think love any kind of songs, you can find any genres here, Pop, R & B, Rap, Gothic, Disco, Mandarin, Cantonese, English, Korean, old, new. But for me every albums I picked here, they have some kind of special meaning for me.
